    description: |
      A comma-separated list of Temporal services to run. Temporal components
      can be either run in a single container or spread across multiple

  num-history-shards:
    description: |
      The number of concurrent database operations that can occur for a Temporal Cluster.
      This value can only be set once at deployment time. Setting the value after it has
      already been set will send the charm into a blocked state until it is set back to the
      original value. This value must be set to a positive power of 2 (e.g. 1, 2, 4).

      This value must be consistent across all components if using a scaled deployment.
